# UCT Mobile App Redesign Project

### Overview

This project is part of the **CSC2002S Mobile Design and Development course**. The objective was to assess the UCT Mobile Appâ€™s current user interface, identify strengths and weaknesses, and propose a refined redesign to improve usability, consistency, and functionality for students.

### Project Structure

- **Evaluation Report**: Comprehensive analysis of the current UCT Mobile App interface based on user feedback and usability testing.
- **Design Prototype**: High-fidelity prototype of the redesigned app interface, featuring new functionalities and layout improvements.
- **User Feedback Analysis**: Summary of survey data, highlighting usability challenges and student-preferred features.
- **Redesign Justification**: Rationale for new design choices, backed by user feedback and mobile design best practices.

### Key Findings and Redesign

#### Strengths of the Current App
- **Tile-Based Layout**: Provides a structured organization and easy navigation of app features.
- **Single Sign-On (SSO)**: Simplifies access to multiple services with a one-time login.

#### Weaknesses of the Current App
- **Inconsistent User Flow**: Some tiles link externally, while others display in-app content, leading to a fragmented experience.
- **Overwhelming Interface**: Excessive tiles with limited organization cause information overload and navigation difficulties.

#### Proposed Redesign

1. **Consistent Navigation**  
   - All tiles now display content within the app, creating a seamless and cohesive user flow.

2. **Personalized Dashboard**  
   - Greets students with upcoming classes, assignments, and events tailored to individual needs.

3. **Integrated Calendar & Reminders**  
   - Allows students to sync their academic calendar and set reminders for assignments, exams, and events, promoting better time management.

4. **Streamlined Tile Organization**  
   - Tiles are reorganized into defined categories to reduce cognitive load and improve ease of access.

### Prototype

The interactive prototype of the redesigned app is available at:  
[UCT Mobile App Prototype](https://uct2024prototypeapp.web.app)  
This prototype demonstrates the redesigned layout, including the personalized dashboard and calendar feature.

### Installation

The project currently consists of design assets and documentation rather than executable code. To view the prototype:
1. Visit the [prototype link](https://uct2024prototypeapp.web.app).
2. Use the interactive features to explore the redesigned interface and functionalities.

### Future Work

Potential future directions for this project include:
- Developing a live, functioning app based on the design prototype.
- Incorporating further student feedback for refining the user experience.
- Adding additional functionality, such as campus maps and event notifications.
