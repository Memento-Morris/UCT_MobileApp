UCT Mobile App Redesign Project
Overview
This project is part of the CSC2002S Mobile Design and Development course. The goal was to evaluate the current user interface of the UCT Mobile App, identify its strengths and weaknesses, and propose a refined redesign that enhances the appâ€™s usability, consistency, and functionality for students.

Project Structure
Evaluation Report: A comprehensive analysis of the current UCT Mobile App interface, based on user feedback and usability testing.
Design Prototype: A high-fidelity prototype of the redesigned app interface, including new features and layout improvements.
User Feedback Analysis: A summary of user survey data, including insights into usability challenges and preferred features.
Redesign Justification: Rationale behind the new design choices, backed by user feedback and mobile design best practices.
Key Findings and Redesign
Strengths of the Current App
Tile-Based Layout: Offers easy navigation and a structured organization of app features.
Single Sign-On (SSO): Simplifies access to multiple services with one-time login.
Weaknesses of the Current App
Inconsistent User Flow: Some tiles link to external websites, while others display in-app content, leading to a fragmented user experience.
Overwhelming Interface: Excessive number of tiles with limited categorization causes information overload and navigation challenges.
Proposed Redesign
Consistent Navigation:

All tiles now display content within the app, ensuring a cohesive and uninterrupted user flow.
Personalized Dashboard:

A new dashboard greets students with upcoming classes, assignments, and events, tailored to individual needs for easier navigation.
Integrated Calendar & Reminders:

Sync academic calendars and set reminders for assignments, exams, and events directly within the app, promoting better time management.
Streamlined Tile Organization:

Tiles are reorganized into clearly defined categories to minimize cognitive load and improve ease of access.
Prototype
The interactive prototype of the redesigned app can be accessed at UCT Mobile App Prototype. This prototype showcases the redesigned layout, including the personalized dashboard and calendar feature.

Installation
The project currently consists of design assets and documentation rather than executable code. To view the prototype, follow these steps:

Future Work
Future iterations of this project could include:

Developing a live, functioning app based on the design prototype.
Incorporating additional student feedback to further refine the user experience.
Exploring additional functionality, such as campus maps and event notifications.
